	<h2> Abstract </h2>
	<p class="abstract">
	There have previously been works in creating artificial models that evolve using 
	information from the environment in order to become more fit. 
	In this paper, we present one such experiment in which a snake-like model learns to 
	climb stairs over multiple generations using the information of how successful models 
	in the previous generation were. The paper details the specifications of our simulation, 
	the implementation using a Python library called Panda3D, and an analysis 
	of the model's evolution.

  Images of the agent during simulations from Generation 1 through Generation 6 (left to right).
  Generation 1: Wriggles on the ground in the same position it started.
  Generation 2: Stops rotating its body and instead focuses on bending, constricting, and relaxing.
  Generation 3: Moves forward to the bottom of the staircase after learning how to kick with its heal.
  Generation 4: Makes it up the first step.
  Generation 5: Makes it up two steps.
  Generation 6: Makes it up three steps.
